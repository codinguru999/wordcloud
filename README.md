# wordcloud
make a picture include different size of latters

It is recommended that you try this in jupyter notebook for better result

First we will import the necessary modules to create a word cloud 

then we will the text file from which we will make the cloud of words

now there are 2 functions to modify the file and make a suitable format of file 

then we make a image of the cloud which looks like the file I have attached in the repo.

Have fun with word...
